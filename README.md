## Structure Of The Project

- The prediction page is connected with a Machine Learning Model that uses Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithms to predict the results.
- We have only 1 relevant feature taken into consideration which is the text and then the text is preprocessed and vectorized with the help of TF-IDF Vectorizer to fit into the model and train it.

The text is preprocessed and then fed to the model.

## Deployment Of The Project

After the modeling part, the model is deployed using the Streamlit library on Streamlit Share so that the app is available for usage for everyone.
